## Main functionality:

- 16-bit PWM brightness regulation, without any flickering
- Color temperature regulation, and white color calibration
- Different LED types for full spectre(WW + NW or WW + CW for example)
- Flickering-free power modules and control circuitry schemati
- Step-down based power modules, wich can work at voltage up to 35V - in car, at home, everywhere with 3S(or more) lithium battery pack.
- STM32 microcontroller as a "brain"
- ESP8266 for networking functionality
- DS18B20 as a temperature sensor for fan control logic
- Temperature & fan control with overheat protection
- Energy efficiency:each PM can be switched on\off, fan on\off + fan PWM, sleep\standby modes for main chips.
- Network control by web-interface or android application
- Wake-up from internal li-ion battery, and power on external PSU - perfect for use wih ATX PSU by pulling down PS_ON pin.
- Measuring power supply\main battery voltage - you exactly know when battery low.

## FAQ

[Full FAQ](https://github.com/alicepergatta/KisosvetV2/wiki/FAQ)

**Q**: Can i build own Kisosvet but with different LED's and PM's?

**A**: Yes! You just need to add variables for new LED's\PM's, and if your LED's are less or more powerful - you need to change PM's circuitry(replace DC-DC converter for diffrent type or power)

**Q**: Which DC-DC type converters can be used for PM's?

**A**:  You can use step-up, step-down, and even SEPIC.
Almost all DC-DC converters have same negative feedback voltage control.
Control circuitry, which i made in Kisosvet suitable for any DC-DC converters with negative feedback voltage control)
(maybe you will need rewrite PWM values calculation, it can be inverted)

**Q**: Which LED types can i use?

**A**: Any) It depends on power modules circuitry(DC-DC converter type), and cooling possibilities(heatsink, fan, and thermal grease).

**Q**: How can you describe a typical Kisosvet build configuration?

**A**: I prefear 10W 12V LED's, 4 pieces placed in chess order(like subpixels). This allows me to use lithium battery pack and typical ATX PSU. Also, i made a 10W PM circuit(see schematic) based on cheap step-down converter.
Despite it's cheapness - it's enough powerfull for 10W LED)
