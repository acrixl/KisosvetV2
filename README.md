# KisosvetV2
Smart LED-light for shoting photo, video, and comfort illumination in home)

## Main functionality:

- 16-bit PWM brightness regulation, without any flickering
- Color temperature regulation, and white color calibration
- Different LED types for full spectre(WW + NW or WW + CW for example)
- Flickering-free power modules and control circuitry schemati
- Step-down based power modules, wich can work at voltage up to 35V - in car, at home, everywhere with 3S(or more) lithium battery pack.
- STM32 microcontroller as a "brain"
- ESP8266 for networking functionality
- DS18B20 as a temperature sensor for fan control logic
- Temperature & fan control with overheat protection
- Energy efficiency:each PM can be switched on\off, fan on\off + fan PWM, sleep\standby modes for main chips.
- Network control by web-interface or android application
- Wake-up from internal li-ion battery, and power on external PSU - perfect for use wih ATX PSU by pulling down PS_ON pin.
- Measuring power supply\main battery voltage - you exactly know when battery low.
